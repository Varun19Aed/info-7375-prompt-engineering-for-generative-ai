# REVIEW — watching the cut and fixing what was wrong

Required by the course film-folder convention (`youtube/README.md`): timestamped
problems, the change requested, the re-check, and the human decision.

A render completing is not a review. Everything below came from looking at frames or
listening to the cut, not from a duration probe.

## R1 · 2026-09-15 — Number line bunched into the right quarter

**Where:** B02 `TempDivide`, at T = 2.0.

**Problem:** the three points are plotted on a shared scale so that low and high
temperatures are directly comparable. That is the point of the beat — but at T = 2.0
the divided scores are `[-1, -0.5, 0]` against a scale spanning `-4 … 0`, so all three
dots crowd into the right-hand quarter and three quarters of the panel reads as empty
space rather than as measured distance.

**Requested change:** keep the shared scale (changing it per temperature would destroy
the comparison and would be dishonest), but make the emptiness legible as *scale* and
make the actual quantity explicit.

**Fix:** added half-unit tick marks along the axis, and drew the B→C gap as a labelled
bracket — `gap = 2` at T=0.5, `gap = 1` at T=1.0, `gap = 0.5` at T=2.0.

**Re-check:** re-rendered at frames 90 / 200 / 300. The bracket now shrinks visibly as
T rises, which states the beat's thesis — temperature rescales the gaps — as a number
rather than as a layout.

**Decision:** accepted. This made the beat better than my original design, not merely
un-broken.

## R2 · 2026-09-15 — Tick labels collided with the outcome labels

**Where:** B02, immediately after R1.

**Problem:** the numeric tick labels (`-4`, `-3`, `-2` …) were drawn below the axis, and
so were the outcome letters (`A`, `B`, `C`). Where a point sat on an integer they
overlapped and both became unreadable.

**Fix:** removed the tick numerals entirely — the marks alone carry the scale, and the
points already display their own values — and pushed the outcome letters clear of the
tick zone.

**Re-check:** re-rendered the same three frames. No overlap at any stop.

**Decision:** accepted.

## R3 · 2026-09-15 — The one that mattered: motion finished, narration kept going

**Where:** every beat.

**Problem:** this is not visible in a still, which is why I nearly shipped it. Each
scene's reveals were written as fixed frame offsets — `useRise(22)`, `useRise(150)` —
so every animation completed within roughly five seconds. The beats themselves run 11
to 26 seconds, set by the measured narration. B04 was the worst case: all motion done
by frame 150 of 777, leaving 21 seconds of frozen frame under a continuing voice-over.

That is a "video" that is really a slideshow with narration — the exact failure the
toolkit's SHOW-DON'T-TELL law describes, and it would have passed every automated check
in the pipeline. The mp4 decodes, the audio is in sync, the numbers are correct, the
duration is right.

**Root cause:** the beat's length comes from the audio clock, but the scene components
never read that clock. Two independent timing systems that were never connected.
Compounding it, `remotion_scenes.py` renders each composition at whatever
`durationInFrames` is registered in `Root.tsx`, then freeze-pads the result to the audio
length with ffmpeg — so the render itself was genuinely only ~5 seconds of motion
followed by a frozen tail.

**Fix, in two parts:**
1. `calculateMetadata` in `Root.tsx` now reads a `durationInFrames` prop, so each
   composition renders at its beat's real measured length.
2. `useAt()` in `apertureKit.tsx` converts a fraction into frames, and every reveal in
   all eight scenes was re-expressed as a fraction of the beat (`at(0.34)` rather than
   `44`). `build_beat_sheet.py` now runs a second pass after audio generation to feed
   the measured durations into the props.

**Re-check:** rendered clip durations against measured audio —
B00 12.00s / 11.97s, B01 18.93s / 18.92s, B02 21.40s / 21.40s. Motion now spans the
whole spoken line in each beat.

**Decision:** accepted. The lesson I am keeping: "audio-first" is not only about the
final concatenation. If the visuals do not also read the clock, you get a correctly
timed video full of static frames, and every automated gate will call it fine.

## R4 · 2026-09-15 — Runtime came in under target; decided not to pad

**Problem:** measured narration totals 158.96s (2:39). I had been aiming at 3:00–3:30.

**Options considered:** `compile.py` pads audio with `apad` and freeze-extends video to
whatever `actual_duration_s` says, so I could have added ~20 seconds of trailing holds
without touching the script, and hit three minutes exactly.

**Decision: do not pad.** The toolkit's duration doctrine is explicit — *"Duration is an
output, never a target… Padding to reach 1:00 is as wrong as compressing to reach
0:30."* 2:39 is inside the assignment's stated 2–4 minute window. Adding silence to
reach a round number would be padding under any honest description, and this is a video
about not overstating what you have.

**Human decision:** mine. Recorded here so the choice is inspectable rather than
implicit.

## R5 · 2026-09-15 — The video displayed a temperature it could not support

**Where:** B00 `TempHook`, and the same bug latent in B02 `TempDivide`.

**Problem:** I pulled a frame from the compiled master and the readout said
**"T = 0.9"**. There is no T = 0.9 anywhere in this project. The hook tweens bar
heights between verified distributions, and I had let the temperature label
interpolate along with them.

Two things were wrong with that. 0.9 is not one of the chapter's temperatures, so the
number had no source. Worse, the bars beside it were a *linear blend* of the T=1.0 and
T=0.5 distributions, which is not the true softmax at 0.9 — so the frame paired an
unsourced number with a distribution that does not exist.

**Why it matters more than it looks:** this video's entire argument is that you should
be able to say where every number came from. A single frame showing an invented
temperature would have undercut the claim the video spends three minutes making. It
also would have passed every automated check — Gate V measures layout and contrast, not
whether a number is real.

**Fix:** the readout now snaps to the stop the bars are moving *toward*, in both
scenes. Bar heights still tween, because a tween is a visual transition rather than a
claim; a number on screen is a claim. Applied the same rule to the divided scores in
B02, which fade during transit rather than counting through values that were never
computed.

**Re-check:** re-rendered B00 and B02, pulled the same frame from the new master —
"T = 1.0". Swept the remaining frames for any figure not present in `numbers.json`;
none found.

**Decision:** accepted. This is the defect I am most glad I caught.

## R6 · 2026-09-15 — Orphaned word on the final card

**Where:** B07 `TempClose`.

**Problem:** the course line wrapped, leaving "01" alone on its own line — on the last
frame of the video, which is the frame a viewer looks at longest.

**Fix:** `whiteSpace: nowrap` on that line, narrower notes column, slightly smaller
mono size.

**Re-check:** re-rendered; the line sits on one row and the card is balanced.

**Decision:** accepted.

---

## R7 · 2026-09-15 — Script fact-check found two statements the project could not support

**Where:** B01 and B05 narration.

**Problem 1 — the scores' provenance was never spoken.** The hook asks what temperature
changes "in a language model" and the close refers to "the model's existing score
differences", but nothing in the narration said that `[1, 2, 3]` were chosen by hand.
The chapter is blunt about this: *"In this example I have chosen them; no model produced
them"* (`:134`). A viewer could have left believing those were real model logits.

**Problem 2 — a false generalisation.** B05 said *"Take any two outcomes and divide
their probabilities … Here that gap is exactly one."* The gap is one for B–A and C–B,
but it is **two** for C–A, where the ratio at T=0.5 is 54.598, not 7.389. The sentence
invited the viewer to apply a number to a pair it does not describe.

**Fix:** B01 now says *"The chapter chose these by hand — no model produced them,"* and
carries a second chip, `CHOSEN BY HAND · NOT MODEL OUTPUT`. B05 now says *"Between the
top two outcomes that difference is exactly one."*

**Re-check:** regenerated audio for both beats (B01 18.92s → 22.14s, B05 24.60s →
25.60s), re-rendered, recompiled. Runtime 2:39 → 2:43. Gate V still 0/0.

**Decision:** accepted. Neither was a wrong number — every figure had already been
verified. Both were failures of *precision in language*, which for this video is the
same category of error as a wrong number.

## R8 · 2026-09-15 — Strike-through rule overran its text

**Where:** B01, visible in the corrected master.

**Problem:** the orange rule struck through "these sum to 6" continued well past the
"6" to the right edge of the column. The element was `display: inline-block`, but its
parent is a flex **column**, whose children stretch to full width by default — so the
absolutely-positioned rule spanned the stretched box rather than the text.

**Fix:** `alignSelf: 'flex-start'` so the box shrinks to its content.

**Re-check:** re-rendered B01 and re-read the frame.

**Decision:** accepted.
