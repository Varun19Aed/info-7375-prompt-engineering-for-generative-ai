build_beat_sheet.py — generates beat_sheet.json from numbers.json.

Why this exists: the assignment requires that no numerical value be typed by hand
into more than one place. verify_temperature.py produces numbers.json; this script
is the only thing that turns those values into scene props. Narration text lives
here too, so a narrated figure and a displayed figure cannot drift apart.

Run verify_temperature.py first — this script refuses to run without numbers.json.
